# Introduction and Language Family

## Important Features of the Language

- Widespread palatalization of consonants (Also present in other Slavic Languages)
- Extensive nominal morphology
- Simple verb system

# Orthography

- Russian uses the **Cyrillic alphabet** (русский -	[ˈruskʲɪj])
- There are 32 letters and an *additional sign for palatalization* [^33]
    - Ь indicates palatalization of the previous consonant.
    - Ъ is silent; it prevents palatalization of the preceding consonant.
- Stress is not normally indicated orthographically. An optional acute accent is used to mark it when distinguishing between homographic words.

[^33]: This is sometimes reported as 33 letters. I have kept the 'additional sign for palatalization'

# Orthography

# Phonology and Phonetics - Vowels

- 5 vowels or 6?
- Phonemic status of the i/ɨ alternation: 
    - ɨ occurs only after non-palatalized consonants
    - i only after palatalized ones and word-initially
    - They could be considered complementary sounds and not separate phonemes.
- The reduced i and u vowels of the ancestral Slavic language were lost in Russian.

# Phonology and Phonetics - Consonants

- There are 36 consonants.
- Consonant palatalization is widespread
    - **[ts]**, **[ʃ]**, **[ʒ]** lack palatalized counterparts.
    - **[tɕ]**, **[ɕ]**, **[j]**, are always palatalized, lacking counterparts.
- Palatalization is represented by an accent mark over the letter.

# Phonology and Phonetics - Stress
Stress can fall on any syllable and it may serve to differentiate lexical or morphological forms. For instance, muká (‘flour’) versus múka (‘torment’), rukí (genitive singular) versus rúki (nominative plural).

Stress is not normally indicated orthographically. An optional acute accent is used to mark it when distinguishing between homographic words.

# Phonology and Phonetics - Syllable Structure 

Syllable structure can be complicated, wih inital and final consonant clusters of upto 4 consecutive sounds: **CCCCVCCCC**

These clusters are not very common. Examples: 
- взгляд ([vzglʲat], 'glance') 
- государств ([gəsʊˈdarstf], 'of the states')

Syllables cannot span multiple morphemes.

# Morphology

Russian Morphology is **highly fusional**

# Morphology - Nouns

Russian nominal morphology has retained part of the complexity of Old Church Slavonic:

- It has lost the vocative case
- The number of declension types has been reduced
- The dual number has disappeared

Definite and Indefinite Articles do not exist

# Morphology - Nouns

| **Property**   | **Values**                                                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gender**     | masculine, neuter, feminine                                                    |
| **Number**     | singular, plural                                                               |
| **Case**       | nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative/prepositional |
| **Adjectives** | masculine singular, neuter singular, feminine singular, plural                 |
| **Pronouns**   | personal, possessive, demonstrative, interrogative, relative                   |

Table: General characteristics covered under Nominal Morphology

# Morphology - Nouns and Case 

Russian noun cases may supplant the use of prepositions entirely. Furthermore, every preposition is exclusively used with a particular case (or cases).

# Morphology - Nouns and Case 

Russian has four major types of noun declension: a-stem, masculine o-stem, neuter o-stem and i-stem.

- Most a-stem nouns are feminine (but those that refer to a male are masculine).
- Almost all i-stems are feminine.
- O-stem nouns are masculine or neuter.

# Morphology - Nouns and Adjectives

- Plural forms do not distinguish gender
- Neuter and Masculine adjectives differ in nominative and accusative 
- Feminine sing. adjectives: one form for genitive, dative, instrumental, locative 

![Declension of *staryj* (old)](./adj.jpg)

# Morphology - Nouns and Pronouns

## Personal Pronouns

- Declined in all 6 cases
- Distinguish Gender in **3rd Person Singular**
- 2nd plural form may be used as a polite singular

![Personal pronouns in Russian](./perspron.jpg){ width=80% }

# Morphology - Nouns and Pronouns

## Possessive Pronouns/Adjectives

- Declined in all cases
- Distinguish gender in the singular, **Exception** of 3rd person forms

![Possessive Pronouns](./pospron.jpg){ width=80% }


# Morphology - Nouns and Pronouns

## Demonstrative Adjectives 
Neuter single forms are *used as demonstrative pronouns*

![Demonstrative Adjectives as Pronouns](./demad.jpg){ width=60% }

## Interrogative Pronouns
Mainly: kto (‘who?’) and čto (‘what?’)

Others: kotoryj (‘what?/which?’) and kakoj (‘what kind of?’). 

All of the above can also function as relative pronouns.

# Morphology - Nouns and Pronouns

## Indefinite pronouns
Formed by adding `-to`/`-nibud` to interrogative pronouns.

## (The only) Reflexive Pronoun
`sebja` ('himself, herself')

# Morphology - Nouns and Animacy

 **Animacy** is relevant in nominal and adjectival declensions.

The Accusative has two possible forms depending on animacy of the referent

- For Animate referents (persons, animals), accusative is generally identical to genitive
- For Inanimate referents, accusative is identical to nominative 



# Morphology - Verbal

Far simpler than Nominal Morphology

The infinitive is the only non-finite form widely used.

| **Property**          | **Values**                                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Person and Number** | 1s, 2s, 3s; 1p, 2p, 3p                           |
| **Modality**          | indicative, imperative                           |
| **Tense**             | past, non-past, imperfective future, conditional |
| **Aspect**            | imperfective, perfective                         |
| **Voice**             | active, passive (infrequent)                     |

Table: General characteristics covered under Verbal Morphology

# Morphology - Verbal, Tense

*past, non-past, imperfective future, conditional*

- *past, non-past*: only tenses formed without auxiliary
- *non-past*: verbs agree with subject in **person, number**
- *past*: verbs agree with subject in **gender, number**
- *imperfective future*: auxiliary=`budu`('will be') + future form of verb + infinitive
- *conditional*: past tense + 'by'

# Morphology - Verbal, Tense

![Tenses](./tense.jpg){ width=60% }

# Morphology - Verbal, Aspect

*imperfective, perfective*

- **imperfective**: incomplete/ongoing action
- **perfective**: completed action

# Morphology - Verbal, Aspect

perfective = prefix + imperfective

The prefix is unpredictable: May change meaning of verb, or not.

1. to read: čitat (imperfective), to read: pročitat (perfective)
2. to write: pisat (imperfective), to write: napisat (perfective)
3. to write: pisat (imperfective), to describe: opisat (perfective)

# Morphology - Verbal, Voice and Non-Finite forms

## Voice

There is Active and Passive voice, but usage of Passive is infrequent.

## Non-Finite forms

The only common one is the *infinitive*

Participles and Gerunds are only used in literary language.


# Syntax

Very flexible SVO

Case system is enough to indicate function of words in sentences

# Syntax

## What's missing

No articles

Copula ('to be' verb) is omitted in the present tense
# Syntax

## Positions of structures

Prepositions, rather than postpositions

Subordinate clauses follow main clauses

Adjectives precede nouns, agree in gender, number, case.

# Syntax

## Agreement of finite verbs

Finite verbs agree with their subjects in:

- Person and number in non past tense
- Gender and number in past tense

# Semantics

## Colours

Russian appears to be an exception to Berlin and Kay's suggestion that languages should have a maximum of 11 basic colour terms.

Russian has 12. There's distinction between light and dark blue.

*belyj* --> *cernyj* --> *krasnyj* --> *zelenyj* --> *zeltyj* --> **sinij**   --> **goluboj**--> *koricnevyj* --> *fioletovyj* --> *rozovyj* --> *oranzevyj* --> *seryj* 

white --> black --> red --> green --> yellow --> *dark blue* --> *light blue* --> brown --> purple --> pink --> orange --> grey


# Semantics

## Kinship terms

Relationship terms exist for:

- Immediate blood relations
- Great uncles/aunts
- In-laws
- Paternal/maternal distinction of grandparents/cousins
- No Paternal/maternal distinction of uncles/aunts 
- Male/female distinction of cousins
- Male/female distinction of second cousins
- Step-family
- Great grandparents/grandchildren

# Cultural Significance

## Literature

- Pushkin, poetry
- Nikolai Gogol, novelist
