# Introduction and Language Family

## Important Features of the Language

- Widespread palatalization of consonants (Also in other Slavic Languages)
- Extensive nominal morphology
- Simple verb system

# Orthography

- Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet (русский -	[ˈruskʲɪj jɪˈzɨk])
- There are 32 letters, and an *additional sign for palatalization*
    - Ь indicates palatalization of the previous consonant.
    - Ъ is silent; it prevents palatalization of the preceding consonant.

# Phonology and Phonetics - Vowels

- 5 vowels or 6?
- Phonemic status of the i/ɨ alternation: 
    - ɨ occurs only after non-palatalized consonants
    - i only after palatalized ones and word-initially
    - They could be considered complementary sounds and not separate phonemes.
- The reduced i and u vowels of the ancestral Slavic language were lost in Russian.

# Phonology and Phonetics - Consonants

- There are 36 consonants.
- Consonant palatalization is widespread
    - **[ts]**, **[ʃ]**, **[ʒ]** lack palatalized counterparts.
    - **[tɕ]**, **[ɕ]**, **[j]**, are always palatalized, lacking counterparts.
- Palatalization is represented by an accent mark over the letter.
