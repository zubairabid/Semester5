## Approach towards Language Universals

**Chomskyan** vs **Greenbergian**

### Chomsky

- Mentalism
- Data: 1
- Degree of abstractness: X-bar. The abstraction is very high.

*General Notes on Chomsky*: He talks about language innnateness, having a Universal Grammar. Based on the fact that all kids learn languages the same way.

### Greenberg

- Behaviourism
- Data: 300+
- Degree of abstraction: Surface structure

#### Universals given by Greenberg

Can be word order, or placement of adjuncts, or at the morphology level.

We will be looking at his 44 Universals later.

**Word Order**:

- Syntactic
    
    - No language is 100% of one type
    - Most SOV languages are post-positional
- Morphology
- Phonetic

## Types of Universals

1. Formal vs Substantives
    
    *Formal*: language has rules, we have to follow them

    *Substantive*: Have categories. Within nouns you may have subcategories. 

2. Absolute vs Statistical
    
    Eg: For statistical, all languages have a minimum of 3 vowels, max od 11. Absolute: "All languages have verbs"

3. Implicational vs Non-implicational

    We take 2 universals for this, that are dependent.

    Eg: if a language is of **SOV** it is **post-positional**. NOT ABSOLUTE.




## Notes in class

*Typology vs Universals*: Typology is the study of differences,  classifying by studying structure and functional features. Universal is a pattern occurring universally across all languages 

*Competence and Performance*: with the example of a baby, having a thought but unable to represent it in the language. 

*Berlin and Kay colour terms*

*Presentation*: Pick a non-Indian language that we do not know. 

- Do a linguistic study, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, .... Something special about the language. 
    
    Look at causatives, relativisation. Features. Inflection etc. Lexical level or Morphology level or Syntactic level etc etc.

- Do not have to educate on difference from Indian languages or anything

- 10 Minutes to do the presentation.

- 8-12 pages: the report/term paper.

- Bonus: Extra effort

- Apply the study of two months to the target language constantly.


*Referring to Emeneau's Paper*: Read **Masica**

- This paper refers to numerals and classifiers
- 

## Language Universals: Formal and Substantive

We have:

Formal - Substantive

Absolute - Tendencies

Implicational - Non-Implicational

Manish Sir is taking the class.

## Writing Systems

- First writing systems? Would you consider pictures to be writing system

- Like a language, a writing system needs to be productive

- Conveying an idea is one part of writing. There will be rules.

- Why does language and writing have to be connected?

- Brings up: speech, language, and writing. And there is evidence that speech does not necessarily translate to written language. Eg: Chinese is a good one. 

- "It should associate itself with all the capabilities of the language" - but the burden of productivity lies with the language, and the writing system is tied to the language.

    Saujas: writing systems have their own productivity

### Summarising
- Has to be consistent, by convention

- It's not expressing anything new. It has to do with expression of what is expressed by the language.

    Ujwal: what about math? 

    Sir: Math is sort of a language itself, so to speak. (so to speak repeated by Saujas, sarcastically). The language itself cannot be called a language, linguistically. But considering the connection with written form, it's as expressive, productive, etc: hallmarks of a language?

    Saujas: Math writing has to be unambiguous. 

- Purpose of writing systems is persistency, not [missed]

### Persistence of Writing?

- Speech is transient: if phonemes are missed, it's gone. 

- The persistence factor of writing comes from what can be done with it.

- Written communication can allow for a more nuanced expression. Expressibility increases, spontaneity is lost

- Writing is independent of the discourse situation. 

- Writing allows for time delays before responding

- Writer has freedom to express veeery vague idea

- Writing is monologue-ic. Speech is (always) dialogue, with the exception of maybe plays.

- Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, just an aside. 

- Writing reduces the load of memorization

- Writing allows for more complexity, speech allows for more nuance.

    Eg: Expressing sarcasm in writing. Or appreciation.

- Writing more objective.

- Allows for higher degree of fossilization.

- Writing requires standardization


### *General question: Sign language*

- Would sign language be a speech system/writing system?

- How to transcribe sign. 


*There's a lot being said about pauses, no idea how to note this*

Ah yes it was about writing devices, and a segue into punctuation.

So point is: punctuation does not relate to pauses, and pauses don't necessarily relate to language too.


*Looking at ideographs*

- ???

- Ideographs aren't real sweaty

- How to represent new concepts in an ideographic system.

- How do we get to sound correspondence again.

- Bad pronunciations of Sayar.

- Typology
- Word Order
- Morphology
- Deep structures

- Approach
- Data
- Abstraction

- Broca's
- Wernicke

Language acquisition vs language loss is that ^^

- Causative
    - Lexical: eat-feed
    - Sentence: verb-make verb
    - Morph
    
    In different languages


## Relative Clauses

- Usually a subordinate clause


### Restrictive and Non Restrictive Relative clauses

# 30.09.2019

- Summaries will be put online so others can also read it.
- Actual dates are yet to be fixed.
- It will be in class hours

### Task before new topic
IPA chart in native language, from memory

## Phonological Typology + universals
