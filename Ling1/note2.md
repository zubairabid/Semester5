## Approach towards Language Universals

**Chomskyan** vs **Greenbergian**

### Chomsky

- Mentalism
- Data: 1
- Degree of abstractness: X-bar. The abstraction is very high.

*General Notes on Chomsky*: He talks about language innnateness, having a Universal Grammar. Based on the fact that all kids learn languages the same way.

### Greenberg

- Behaviourism
- Data: 300+
- Degree of abstraction: Surface structure

#### Universals given by Greenberg

Can be word order, or placement of adjuncts, or at the morphology level.

We will be looking at his 44 Universals later.

**Word Order**:

- Syntactic
    
    - No language is 100% of one type
    - Most SOV languages are post-positional
- Morphology
- Phonetic

## Types of Universals

1. Formal vs Substantives
    
    *Formal*: language has rules, we have to follow them

    *Substantive*: Have categories. Within nouns you may have subcategories. 

2. Absolute vs Statistical
    
    Eg: For statistical, all languages have a minimum of 3 vowels, max od 11. Absolute: "All languages have verbs"

3. Implicational vs Non-implicational

    We take 2 universals for this, that are dependent.

    Eg: if a language is of **SOV** it is **post-positional**. NOT ABSOLUTE.




## Notes in class

*Typology vs Universals*: Typology is the study of differences,  classifying by studying structure and functional features. Universal is a pattern occurring universally across all languages 

*Competence and Performance*: with the example of a baby, having a thought but unable to represent it in the language. 

*Berlin and Kay colour terms*
