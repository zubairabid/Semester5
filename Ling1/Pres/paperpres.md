## Overview

- Literature Survey, of sorts, of work done in Gujarati grammar studies till date.
- Differentiates earlier approaches (pedagogical, prescriptive) from newer ones (not pedagogical, descriptive)
- "It is clear in my mind that ... Gujarati (for that matter any of the Indian Languages) has not contributed in the area of development of modern linguistic science."

# Past
