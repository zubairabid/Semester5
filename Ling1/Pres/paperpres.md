# An Overview of Grammatical Studies in Gujarati (Bharati Modi)

## Overview

- Literature Survey, of sorts, of work done in Gujarati grammar studies till date.
- Differentiates earlier approaches (pedagogical, prescriptive) from newer ones (not pedagogical, descriptive)
- "It is clear in my mind that ... Gujarati (for that matter any of the Indian Languages) has not contributed in the area of development of modern linguistic science."

# Past

- 'Pre-modern linguistic grammars' : 1800-1950
- Pedagogical grammars for teaching and standardization
- 


# Language Modernization: Structural and Sociolinguistic Aspects (S. N. Sridhar)

## Overview

- Defines 'Modernization' of languages
- Discusses 'Purist' vs 'Pragmatist' approaches to modernization, especially with Indian languages
- Examines Macro and Micro strategies in language development
- Takes Kannada as a case study

# Modernization

- With reference to 'other developed languages'
- Developing languages import structures wholesale
    - Show resource preferences
    - Differ in linguistic processes employed to modernize, assimilate. Historical and Sociolinguistic factors too.

# Modernization in Indian Languages

- Lack of vocabulary for post-renaissance 
- There is a push for move to Hindi/Regional languages (away from english). Modernization is necessary

# Macro-strategies

## Choice of Donor Language

- Indigenization and Cryptocreolization
- Purist Position
    - Politico-cultural factors
    - 'Efficiency' as a reason
- Pragmatist position
    - In Purism, there is more often than not no 'naturalness', is as opaque
    - It becomes 'classicalization'
    - Maintain terminology

# Macro-strategies

## Context and Choice of Resources

# Micro-strategies

Choices internal to grammar and vocabulary

Combination of borrowing and hybridization is common - Japanese, especially.

# Micro-strategies: Mechanisms used

- Explicatory compounds *railu gadi (Hindi)*
- Compounding *vicara sankirana (Kannada)*
- Non-compositional compounds *white paper $\to$ sveta patra*
- Reinterpretation *akasvani*

# Effects of Modernization on Language

- Expansion in size and range of vocabulary
    - A part of Sanskrit derivational morphology has become part of Kannada word formation
    - Generally, coexisting morphological systems
- Multiple levels of lexical structure
    - In Kannada, Sanskrit, Perso-Arabic borrowings ending with -a have become -e words
    - English has not undergone this assimilation
- Lexical expansion can strengthen word classes, like Kannada's adjectives
- Hybrid compounds
- Stem compounds
