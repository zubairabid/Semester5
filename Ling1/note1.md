# Reduplication in Indian Languages

- Compounding vs Echo
    - Echo: second word being nonsensical
    - Compound: Some sort of relation between the two
- Reduplication:

    Entire, valid words that are of the form:
    - N-N
    - V-V
    - Adv-Adv
    - Adj-Adj

    The phrases may have different POS based on usage. Like "ek ek karke" or "ek ek ko"

    Reduplication carries over into English usage too. "Eat little little", "Do that slowly slowly"

- Onomatopoeia
   
   Can be any part of speech, depending on usage.

   Bengali: thok thok, bon bon, tip tip, jhom jhom

### Retroflex

*Krishnamurthy*: retroflex comes from Dravidian languages, which Sanskrit borrowed and then the other Indo-Aryan Languages too.

Alphabet ordering: Voiceless --> Voiceless Aspirated --> Voiced --> Voiced Aspirated.

- Phonological
    - Syllable timed and stress timed?
    - It's not as important in Indian languages: meaning doesn't change
    - English has some, Russian/Chinese too
- Morphological
    - Example of Hindi, with many more cases than English (khilana, khilwana, etc)
    - Examples in Dravidian Languages too.
- Expressive
    - iterated syllables generally Onomatopoeic in nature. The syllables do not make sense in isolation
- Echo Formations
    - base word + [syllable]+base word[1:]
- Word Reduplication
    - Both form and meaning are repeated once.
    - Combined meaning gives various modified meanings
- Syntax
    - Largely SOV
    - Exceptions as SVO: Khasi
- Explicator Compound Verb
    - [ V1 V2 ]
    - Homophonous, both exist, but V2 only appears in context of V1
- Defining Characteristics of Explicators
    - They have some, refer to the book.

- Converbs/Conjunctive participles (CP)
    - Constructions containing nonfinite verbal forms that subjoin sentences to the left of the main finite verb
- Lots of areal diffusion
