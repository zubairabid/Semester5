#### In Chronological Order,

- Newtonian
- Lagrangian
- Hamiltonian

We define a new function, called the *Lagrangian*:
\begin{displaymath} 
L(q, \dot{q}, t) \textsc{, where} 
\end{displaymath}

- $q$ is the generalized coordinates
- $\dot{q}$ is the generalized velocity. 
- $\dot{q} = \frac{dq}{dt}$. The dependence on time is implicit, not explicit.

The energy represented in a Lagrangian is:

$L = K(q) - U(\dot{q})$

**Of many paths that can be taken in between 2 states $(q_1, \dot{q_1})$ and $(q_2, \dot{q_2})$ the path taken is the *Path of least action* ** 

## Deriving Lagrange's Equations of Motion:

Consider 2 paths: POLA and a neighbouring. Let $\delta q$ be difference in the two's $q$s. We get

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}})$

Now, next step:

## Relation between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian:

$H = \sum_i (\dot{q_i}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}} - L)$

To prove this, calculate  $\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}$ and plug Lagrange's Equation into the term with $\dot{q_i}$ numerator.

Something about time explicit.
