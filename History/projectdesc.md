## Title
**Analyzing Economic movement in India through a study of Forest Records**

## Short Introduction
From around 1890 onwards, the DSAL UChicago has records of British Surveys on a multitude of things, including forest produce economics. The goal of my project is to try and draw a correlation between forest economics and the economy at large, to verify the claim [here](http://www.fao.org/forestry/country/57478/en/ind/)
