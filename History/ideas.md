- Look at the contribution of agriculture and forestry to the Indian economy
- Do this for 1870-1920 and 1950-now
- Check for correlation in the GDP and forestry. Should be none
- My theory here is: forestry could potentially be used more to contribute to the economy, but due to conservation efforts that is not done.
