**Topic: Forests and the Economy of India**

# Abstract 

- Forests are important to the local economy living close to them
- Their contribution to the National GDP however is low
- 3 things:
    - Is there a reduced dependence on forestry?
    - Are there localised blobs/states with greater reliance on forestry:
        - Indirect methods
        - Through forest cover, multiple years
        - What's the relation to GDP over time in these states?
    - Specific to the North-East states, have conservation policies affected this relation? 

# Contribution of Forest Products to the overall GDP of the country

- Describe data source, methods
- Calculating forest contribution from this, base approximation. How it can be improved
- Plot Sector-wise GDP change 
- Plot correlation of forest-economy

# Examining Local (State-level) impact

- Methods of getting state-level breakdown:
    - Reliance on non-agriculture data, and geographic location
    - Estimating from forest cover
- Graph of non-agriculture data, sorted
- Graph of %age forest cover by state in 2017
- Observations:
    - take from slides
    - All states are either NE or coastal
    - In forest cover, 6/7 NE states, and A&N (also some goa)
    - 
- For each state with major forest cover + non agriculture, plot forest cover over time + reliance on non-agriculture
- Observations:
    - to
    - do


- Arunachal Pradesh:
    - Forest Cover over time 
    - GDP Contribution over time 



# Conservation


















## North-East

"The North-East Region had recorded major losses in the 1995 assessment"[^ne95]
