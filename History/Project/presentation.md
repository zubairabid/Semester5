# Introducing the Topic
- Studies have shown the importance of Forest Products to the local economy, in terms of impact on individual households.[^need]
- However, the total contribution of forests to the national GDP is very low.[^fao] 
- Has the dependence on forest produce decreased? Are there localised blobs with greater reliance on such?

# What is Analysed
- The contribution of Forest products to the overall GDP of the nation.
- The localised impact of Forests on specific States.
- Possible correlation between reduction in forest cover and increase in products.

Time frame: Post-independence India, 1951-2014

# The contribution of Forest products to the overall GDP of the nation

## Methods
- We take data released by the Planning Commission[^sectorwise] and graph the changes in multiple sectors.
- Since exact Forestry data was not directly found for much of the date range, (it is classified under "Agriculture, forestry, and fishing") we estimate the breakdown by extrapolation, and graph that as well.

# The localised impact of Forests on Specific States

## Measuring the Impact
Barik, S. K., and S. K. Mishra[^nepaper] studied the contribution of forests to the economy of the northeastern States of India
- They refer to the lack of immediately available data and the needs for estimates to understand how much of the GDP forests actually contribute to 
- As such, the only direct data they have available is on Meghalaya

Since we lack data, to see specific States that may depend on Forest produce more we use another indirect method
