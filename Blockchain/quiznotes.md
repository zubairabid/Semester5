Blockchain
==========

1. *What is Blockchain*?

    Blockchain is a Distributed Database.

    It is:
    - Append only
    - Transparent
    - Incorruptible (under mild assumptions)
    - Secure
    - Time-stamped
    - With Distributed Consensus

# Financial Arrangements

## Barter
Simple enough: If A has b but wants a and B has a but wants b then the two can swap with each other. What is A has c and wants a, but B has a but wants b? We look for C who has b and wants c, and then we can arrange for an exchange.

### The issue:
Getting the people to get together and arrange an exchange.

### Solution:

1. Cash
2. Credit

#### Credit

Make the transaction, be in debt until repayment after.

#### Cash

Denominating some cash value to all goods, and using cash to buy and sell.

# Cryptographic Hash Functions

Properties:

- Deterministic
- Efficient to compute
- Pre-image resistance
- Second pre-image resistance
- Collision resistance
- Small change in the input should modify hash extensively
- Fixed side output, for input of any size
