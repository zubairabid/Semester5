<p>In systems, I/O is limited. Domain –&gt; I/O characteristics</p>
<p>Example of analogue system enforcing constraints: Telegraph</p>
<p>So do we enforce constraints in Natural Language, or take text from the wild and process it to fit the constraints? Same input and algo can perform differently if preprocessed differently.</p>
<h2 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h2>
<p>Task of separating ‘tokens’ in a given sentence.</p>
<p>token: a single surface form word</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: is a vocabulary word.</p>
<p>Core principle: Do not lose information at this phase. Input will be frozen. <em>Suggestion</em>: break everything, reconstruction is fine.</p>
